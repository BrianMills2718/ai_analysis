The limitations of each measure are discussed, particularly the challenges of using fitness tests to evaluate resilience programs due to factors like body weight and genetic inheritance."

Outcomes of interest included changes in depressive symptomatology, quality of life, and adverse effects. Meta-analyses for efficacy outcomes and the number of patients with adverse events were conducted using the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method for random-effects models to estimate the relative risk (RR) and standardized mean differences (SMDs), together with the 95- percent confidence interval (CI). For specific adverse events, many of which are very rare, we used exact conditional methods to estimate odd ratios (ORs).

Data analysis involved qualitative thematic analysis of interviews and open-ended survey responses, descriptive analysis of the minimum data set, before-and-after comparisons using fixed-effects multilevel regression models in four sites, and an economic evaluation. The economic evaluation used a cost-benefit analysis comparing the National Model to local models in four sites, incorporating Bayesian expert elicitation to estimate health benefits due to data limitations.  It considered three scenarios for criminal justice outcomes to account for uncertainty about the counterfactual (what would have happened without the National Model).  The methodology section extensively details the data sources, cost calculations, and assumptions made in the economic evaluation, including the use of national averages for sentence lengths and costs, and the estimation of health benefits using QALYs."

The SCG method constructs a synthetic control group from other districts to compare with the intervention district.  Both methods use publicly available aggregate data obtained from state department of education websites.  The analysis accounts for demographic variables and pre-intervention performance.

Data from the 2006-2007 to 2008-2009 school years are used as pre-intervention data.  Some adjustments are made to account for the merger of MCS with Shelby County Schools and the transfer of some MCS schools to the Achievement School District.",

Second, a regression is run on the differences between actual and predicted outcomes to estimate the treatment effect.  The SCG method involves constructing a weighted average of comparison districts that closely resembles the intervention district in pre-intervention characteristics.  Statistical inference for the DiD method uses a random-effect model to account for within-district correlation.  The SCG method uses permutation tests (placebo effects) for inference."

The method for addressing measurement error in test scores (using two-stage least squares and instrumenting lagged test scores) is described.  The section also explains the three second-stage regressions (Equations 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4) used to estimate overall, within-school, and between-school sorting of teacher effectiveness by student LIM status.  It discusses the choice of using current-year value-added estimates and the rationale behind this decision.  Finally, it addresses the use of site-provided effectiveness estimates (value-added or SGP estimates and composite measures), their rescaling, and the focus on a subsample of teachers for whom VAM could be calculated."

The framework involves four components: insurance coverage, healthcare costs, Dr. Dynasaur revenues, and new revenue requirements. Data sources include the Vermont Household Health Insurance Survey (VHHIS), Vermont Health Care Uniform Reporting and Evaluation System (VHCURES), Vermont demographic projections, and Vermont tax data.  Cost analysis projects healthcare expenditures based on VHCURES data and demographic projections, considering various reimbursement rate scenarios. Administrative costs are modeled with four scenarios based on different administrative cost rates.  The microsimulation model, COMPARE-VT, is used to project insurance coverage, healthcare expenditures, and wage changes.  Three alternative financing strategies (income tax increase, payroll tax, and business enterprise tax) are modeled to meet Dr. Dynasaur 2.0 revenue requirements."

It describes the methods used for projecting healthcare expenditures under different reimbursement rate scenarios, including the handling of inflation and adjustments for unreported costs.  Administrative cost projections are detailed, including one-time costs and variable costs based on enrollment and healthcare utilization. The adaptation of the COMPARE model to the Vermont context (COMPARE-VT) is explained, including reweighting to match VHHIS data and calibration to match 2014 enrollment rates.  The assumptions and simplifications made in the microsimulation model are discussed, particularly regarding wage passback rates and health care utilization.  Finally, the methods for calculating the revenue requirements for each financing strategy are detailed."

Regression models (specifically, heterogeneous variance models estimated using maximum likelihood techniques) were used to correlate these program characteristics with the log of schedule durations. Model refinement involved examining regression statistics, residuals, and addressing potential collinearity issues.

The researchers analyzed BLS data to determine the prevalence of 4-8% annual productivity gains.  The study also considered factors like offsetting investments needed to increase labor productivity and differences in MFP between DoD and the private sector.  Due to data limitations and the unique nature of DoD operations (including wartime demands), a bottom-up approach focusing on identifying and removing specific barriers to efficiency was proposed as a more realistic method for estimating savings."

Papers were grouped by research type (basic, clinical, interventional) and country. A matrix was populated, and papers were randomly selected within each group.  The selection process aimed for a range of research types and countries, mitigating bias but acknowledging pragmatic limitations (e.g., researcher contact)."

Economic capacity is measured by multiplying GDP by GDP per capita. Technological capacity is measured by an index of R&D expenditure, number of researchers, triadic patents, and high-tech exports. Threat is assessed by considering the balance of offensive capabilities and perceived aggressive intentions.  Economic complementarity is measured using factor endowments (capital stock, labor force, skilled labor force, oil and gas reserves, arable land). Ideology is assessed by examining the system of domestic government, views on the international political order, and views on the international economic order, using a 1-5 scale for each component and summing for an overall score."

The sampling frame included all reserve component personnel (excluding cadets, etc.) and utilized 70 strata based on service branch, pay grade, and gender.  Statistical weighting was used to correct for differences between respondents and nonrespondents.  Missing data were imputed using mice in R, employing predictive mean matching (PMM) and polytomous regression.  Analysis involved weighted data and a two-stage procedure for comparisons across military subpopulations (Rao-Scott chi-square test and pairwise comparisons with Tukey-Kramer adjustment).

The section then describes the handling of missing data through imputation using the mice package in R.  It explains the use of predictive mean matching (PMM) for various variable types, the handling of skip logic, and the iterative process (five iterations of MCMC) used for imputation.  Finally, the analysis approach is outlined, emphasizing the use of analytic weights and a two-stage procedure for comparisons across military subpopulations (Rao-Scott chi-square test and pairwise comparisons with Tukey-Kramer adjustment).

The interview protocols were developed through internal brainstorming and reviewed by RAND's Survey Research Group to ensure expansive questioning. Interviews were not recorded to encourage candid responses.  Case studies involved mapping timelines of events, developing narratives, and extracting relevant insights.

Interview preparation involved internal brainstorming, development of generic interview protocols reviewed by RAND's Survey Research Group, and derivation of individual interview protocols tailored to interviewees.  A coding approach using Dedoose software and a code tree (shown in Box A.1) was used to analyze interview notes.  Integrative analysis combined insights from the three exploratory lines of effort, the team's expertise, and literature review to develop recommendations."

This involved 24 workshops and panels (May 2014-November 2018) bringing together criminal justice practitioners, technologists, civil-society representatives, and others. Structured brainstorming sessions were used to identify challenges, solutions, and opportunities to improve the criminal justice system.  The results of each panel are documented in detailed reports. The analysis in this report draws on the full set of issues raised during all events, particularly the reports from the 2014 Corrections, 2015 Courts, and 2016 Law Enforcement Advisory Panels."

The DRM simulates employee decisions to stay or leave based on compensation changes (pay freezes, retirement contribution increases).  Three scenarios were modeled for the pay freeze (permanent cut, immediate restoration, 10-year delay).  For retirement benefit changes, two scenarios were modeled: no wealth effect and fully protecting personal savings by reducing consumption.  The model uses real (inflation-adjusted) dollars for civil service and private sector pay.  Hiring was assumed unchanged in all scenarios."

The stated preference choice model is described, focusing on two choice experiments (value of time and departure time/route choices).  Discrete choice models (nested logit) were estimated using the survey data, separately for mandatory and nonmandatory trips.  Finally, the traffic and revenue model is explained, including its calibration using LPR data, 183A transaction data, and historical data.  The model predicts the probability of travel time and route choice under different tolling schedules."

Data collection involved in-depth, semi-structured interviews (n=41) with CISELSS leadership and staff, partner organizations, and Tier 2 and 3 technical assistance recipients. Purposive sampling was used to select participants with in-depth knowledge and diverse perspectives.  The timing of data collection allowed for analysis of capacity building over time.  Data analysis involved iterative coding, memoing, and analytic matrices using Dedoose software.  Triangulation of data from multiple sources was used to enhance validity.  The study also utilized feedback form data (n=24 in FY2023) from individuals who received Tier 2 or 3 support.  Descriptive analyses were used to summarize feedback form responses.  Limitations of the sampling approach and interview data, as well as limitations of the feedback form data (anonymous responses, low response rate, inability to link responses to specific individuals or organizations) are discussed."

The research team did not make explicit assumptions about system size or cost, but focused on systems of likely interest to the RAN. The analysis aimed to illustrate the breadth of S&T developments and operational opportunities, but did not prioritize missions or provide an implementation roadmap.  Time and resource constraints limited the methodological options; a desk research approach was prioritized over other futures and foresight methodologies."

The analysis involved creating a specific number of classes (types) and sorting each case into the type it most resembled.  The goal was to explain the associations between dimensions and achieve approximate independence of characteristics within each type.

Multiple random starting values were used to ensure the maximum likelihood solution was found. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm handled missing data.  A series of LCA models were fit, increasing the number of classes until a unique solution could not be found. Model fit was assessed using the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC)."

Qualitative data was gathered through a scoping review and environmental scan of literature on APMs (using databases like PubMed, EconLit, CINAHL, and Business Select, as well as grey literature from organizational websites), interviews with WC staff in Ohio and Washington, a focus group with California healthcare providers (from six high-volume specialties identified in the WCIS analysis), a focus group with employer representatives, and individual semi-structured interviews with employee representatives.  Data analysis involved inductive and deductive content analysis of transcripts, with discrepancies resolved through coder consensus.  The PRISMA guidelines were followed for the literature review."

A PAI capability collection and categorization process involved identifying Army-relevant COTS/GOTS capabilities, collecting PAI tools and reports using existing inventories, open-web searches, and SME input (resulting in a refined list of 259 tools and technologies). Scenario-based workshops (using five scenarios: viral Army stories, force protection, early warning, stability operations, and regime change) were conducted with RAND SMEs to elicit PAI needs.  A framework for understanding how PAI analytics sync with military planning processes and operations was adapted from the 2020 PARDIE OIE Technology Development Roadmap, refined through multiple iterations and workshops, resulting in a categorized taxonomy of requirements (five main categories, 19 subcategories, 172 discrete tasks).

Teachers received up to three reminder emails and a $10 incentive. 1,025 teachers completed enough of the survey to receive a weight and are included in the final data file (41% completion rate). 973 teachers completed the school safety module (39% completion rate). Teachers\u2019 survey responses were weighted to be representative of the national population of public school teachers.  The ATP sampling frame was a list of U.S. public school teachers purchased from Market Data Retrieval (MDR). Probability-based sampling methods were used. The survey weights account for the multistep sampling process and teachers\u2019 likelihood of completing the survey.  The final weights are the product of three weights: a calibrated sampling frame weight, sample selection weight, and survey response weight.  The weights were designed to make the panel match the national population of public school teachers, considering school-level and individual teacher-level characteristics. Survey response weights estimate teachers\u2019 likelihood of responding conditional on school- and individual-level characteristics. Differences in teachers\u2019 responses were examined by teacher characteristics (gender, race, experience) and school characteristics (grade level, enrollment size, locale, poverty status, student racial/ethnic composition). School demographic data were obtained by linking survey data files to the Common Core of Data (CCD).  Only statistically significant differences (at the 5% level) are described, unless otherwise noted. Multiple hypothesis test corrections were not applied."

The exploratory phase used desk research to gather and inventory relevant sources, employing various databases and search strings.  Inclusion criteria focused on location (case study countries), language (English, Dutch, German, French, Italian, Swedish), subject (safe country lists, Articles 36 and 37 of the Procedures Directive), date (post-2012), and document type (peer-reviewed publications, grey literature, PhD theses, policy documents, national legislation, editorials, opinion pieces, comments/letters, and blogs). The in-depth phase included additional literature research, jurisprudence research, and semi-structured interviews with experts and stakeholders in the case study countries and the Netherlands.  A total of 18 interviews were conducted (at least three per case study country), using a topic guide based on the research questions.  The interviews were analyzed using an extraction spreadsheet. The findings were used to supplement information from the literature and jurisprudence research and to draft the chapters on the various case study countries.  These draft chapters were then submitted to all interviewed experts for verification and to provide additional information."

The analysis focused on high-intensity operations in a European theater, assuming an Article 5 declaration and full member contributions.  The study used documentary research, interviews, and roundtable discussions with experts from the US and European air forces and NATO commands.  The assessment framework used two factors: force structure and technology (fighter aircraft and munitions inventories, including subsystems and add-ons), and readiness (equipment availability, personnel, training, and exercises). The 13 European nations selected for the study each maintained at least two squadrons of fourth- and/or fifth-generation aircraft, advanced munitions, and associated training."

Case study selection involved evaluating potential programs based on six principal features of Mosaic warfare (fractionation, heterogeneity, rapid composability, system architecture, scalability and multiagent collaboration, and AI/ML and autonomy).  For the immune response analysis, a literature review was conducted, focusing on the immune system's response to pathogens and drawing analogies to various warfighting scenarios. The NIFC-CA analysis involved a literature review of unclassified documents (including those from UARCs, federally funded R&D centers, and Naval Warfare Centers), discussions with Navy subject-matter experts, and leveraging firsthand experience from an author with relevant experience."

Transition matrices are constructed from Markov chains, and their properties are analyzed.  Graph theory is used to analyze the structure of the state space of the Markov chain, even when transition probabilities are unknown.  Several graph statistics (average node degree, degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient, diameter, average distance, cycles, girth, terminal nodes, number of paths to terminal nodes) are used to quantify the size and topology of the graph. The decision flow is presented as a transition matrix, and the impacts of complexity attacks are analyzed by observing changes in the transition matrix and using graph theory to analyze the topology of the decision network."

Health expenditures were estimated using National Health Expenditures Account (NHEA) projected per capita growth rates.  Four policy scenarios were considered for 2020, varying by the availability of FFCRA-related Medicaid continuous enrollment and furlough coverage.

This code was integrated into a prototype tool.  The prototype tool allows users to upload billet files, apply FCoM cost factors, and visualize cost estimates through graphs and tables.  The study used data from the FCoM model, including compensation, healthcare, recruiting, and training costs. Expected years of service (for active duty) and step (for civilian billets) were computed using data from the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) Active Duty and Civilian Master Files, averaging the 10th, 30th, 50th, 70th, and 90th percentile values for each pay grade-service combination from FY 2013 to FY 2018.  The study also used data from the Population Representation of the Military Services report and FedScope to estimate the proportion of the DoD force excluded from the prototype tool due to limitations in FCoM data."

A literature review of 35 sources (including systematic and nonsystematic reviews, quasi-experimental designs, and RCTs) informed the proposed designs.  Recommended outcome measures, compiled from the literature review, the Weinberg Center logic model, and expert consultations, were grouped into four areas: mental and physical health and well-being, legal and justice outcomes, abuse risk, and client-centered goals.  Three evaluation options were presented: 1) Randomization using the opt-in nature of treatment (comparing outcomes of Weinberg Center clients with those who were referred but did not become clients); 2) Propensity score matching (comparing Weinberg Center clients with similar individuals in a secondary data source, such as APS data); and 3) A pre- and post-evaluation design (tracking Weinberg Center clients over time to determine whether client outcomes improve).  Each option included a discussion of potential biases, sample size considerations (including power analysis for Option 1), data collection methods, cost estimates, and timelines.  The chapter also discussed important considerations for evaluators, including working with victims of elder abuse, equity, data security, client and family input, and cost-benefit analysis."

Recalibration ensures alignment with population estimates.  The final weight is the product of these interim weights, with trimming of extreme values at the 95th percentile and reallocation to maintain population totals.

Accuracy was defined as a match between the first character of the PSC in the DD350 record and the first character of the primary RAND-assigned PSC. Adequacy was defined broadly, considering a single PSC adequate if multiple goods or services within an action could be described with codes sharing the same first character.  Analysis involved examining the accuracy and adequacy of the data, exploring the nature of coding errors, and assessing the implications for tracking service expenditures."

Alternative circumstances requiring Army capabilities are identified and plotted on a threat and likelihood chart. A Cobb-Douglas utility function is used to prioritize these circumstances for budgeting.  Investment emphasis is weighted according to likelihood and threat, and then normalized against the FY 2004 acquisition budget to produce final budget recommendations."

The analysis uses a model with up to 13 career stages and one to three jobs per grade, awarding points for meeting job requirements.  The results are compared to 'actual' assignments to highlight potential improvements."

This model accounts for various factors influencing officer career progression.  Gap analysis compares the supply of officers with the required skills to the demand for those skills in different job positions.  The analysis also involves comparing 'optimized' career paths (from the model) to 'actual' career paths to assess potential improvements."

Data were collected from Selected Acquisition Reports (SARs), including development and procurement cost estimates, cost variances by category, unit-cost calculations, contract and procurement quantity information, and narrative discussions.  Two files were created for each program: a narrative document summarizing program history and issues, and a spreadsheet documenting milestones, cost estimates, variances, unit costs, procurement quantities, and trigger events.

These percentages were applied to 11 years of data from the Air Force Total Ownership Cost (AFTOC) database.  Flight data (nearly 20,000 flights) was analyzed to determine distance traveled in each ICAO region, modeling fuel use and flight time under compliant and non-compliant conditions using the KC-10 performance manual and operational practices.  A 14-minute flight delay was applied for non-compliant aircraft transiting regions with projected delays.  Regression analysis was used to model the relationship between nonfuel costs and flying hours.  Cost avoidance was calculated using net present value (NPV) with a 2.8% discount rate.  Cost estimates for modernization were drawn from contractor-based concept refinement studies (CRSs)."

Three missions (homeland defense, OPLAN 8010, and employment) were deemed unaffected by CNS/ATM mandates based on judgment and expert consultation.  For the four affected missions (deployment, air bridge, national reserve, and global strike), the number of tankers required under compliant and non-compliant conditions was calculated using mission descriptions from the KC-X AoA, the Mobility Capabilities Study, and tanker doctrine.  Deployment effectiveness was calculated as the ratio of required compliant tankers to required non-compliant tankers.  The analysis considered the impact of non-compliance in different ICAO regions and the allocation of tankers to different mission types.  Airport access analysis involved examining runways worldwide to identify those newly accessible with RNP 0.15-0.3 capability.  The impact of exclusion from established air refueling tracks and European airspace was also assessed."

Wartime effectiveness was assessed by comparing the number of tankers required to accomplish missions under different compliance scenarios.  Net present value (NPV) was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of modernization."

Sensitivity analyses are conducted to assess the impact of varying demand levels, risk tolerance, AOR-specific management, and political considerations.

A model of terrorist decisionmaking was used to assess technology adoption based on benefits and risks.  A framework was developed to analyze how terrorists acquire and use technologies, considering four technology strategies: specialization, adoption of many technologies, focus on versatile technologies, and opportunistic use.  A framework was also developed to evaluate countermeasures based on technology strategy, benefit/risk balance, and countermeasure options."

            "methods_summary": "This chapter focuses on the challenges of establishing consistent unit cost estimates for the indicators identified in Chapter 4.  It describes the methods used to obtain unit cost estimates for various harms (lifetime medical costs of HIV infection and Hepatitis C, cost of Hepatitis B, intangible costs of addiction, cost of law enforcement for drug offenses).  The chapter details the sources and methods used for each cost estimate, highlighting variations in approaches across countries.  For example, it explains the use of previous studies, adjustments for inflation, currency conversions, and different modeling approaches (Markov models) to estimate lifetime costs of diseases.  The chapter also discusses the use of top-down approaches for estimating law enforcement costs, acknowledging the limitations of this method and the variations in data availability and definitions across countries."

The specific countries included vary depending on data availability and quality.  The chapter focuses on a subset of developed countries with relatively good data, including the United States, Canada, Australia, the UK, Spain, France, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands.",
        "analysis_approach": "The analysis involves a comparative review of existing national studies, followed by an attempt to construct a consistent estimate of the economic burden of drug use across a selected group of countries.  The analysis highlights the challenges of cross-national comparison due to differences in data collection, definitions, and costing methods.  The study uses both top-down and bottom-up approaches for cost estimation, depending on the availability of data."
