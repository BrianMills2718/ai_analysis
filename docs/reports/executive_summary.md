## Executive Summary
Generated: June 10, 2025

### Core Question Answered
**"What methods are being used by whom, and how is AI being used in those methods?"**

### Key Findings

#### 1. Method Usage Landscape
- **231 unique methods** tracked across 9,129 documents (2016-2025)
- **Top 5 methods**: Case Study (43,807 uses), Literature Review (39,101), Simulation (26,925), Systematic Review (23,452), Meta-Analysis (20,273)
- **67.3% collaboration rate** with average 4.1 authors per document

#### 2. AI Integration Status
- **AI method usage grew 2,840%** from 2016 to 2025
- AI methods now represent **31.4% of all method usage** (up from 5.4% in 2016)
- Only **2.4% of active method usage** includes AI integration (based on Gemini analysis sample)
- **Peak AI adoption in 2024** with continued growth trajectory

#### 3. Division Specializations (Location Quotient Analysis)
- **RAND Science & Technology**: AI methods dominant (AI governance LQ: 2.58, neural networks LQ: 2.58)
- **RAND Health Care**: Clinical methods specialized (Modified Delphi LQ: 15.31, Microsimulation LQ: 15.31)
- **RAND Education & Labor**: Causal inference focus (Center for Causal Inference LQ: 9.41)
- **RAND Justice Policy**: Advanced analytics (semantic search LQ: 11.53, survival analysis LQ: 11.53)
- **RAND International**: Counterfactual analysis leadership (LQ: 12.81)

#### 4. Method Champions & Networks
- **Brian A. Jackson**: Top champion for multiple methods (Literature Review, Risk Assessment, Clustering)
- **AI method leaders**: James Black (21 uses), Matthew Walsh (16 uses), Benjamin Boudreaux (15 uses)
- **Strong author networks**: 9,533 unique authors with clear methodological communities

#### 5. Temporal Evolution Patterns
- **60% of methods classified as "Emerging"** (growing usage)
- **40% classified as "Growing"** (steady increase)
- **Fastest growing**: artificial intelligence (22,264% growth), CNN (937%), Wargaming (627%)
- **New methods post-2020**: Primarily AI/ML related

### Strategic Insights

1. **AI Adoption Gap**: Despite rapid growth, AI integration remains limited (2.4% of active usage)
2. **Division Silos**: Clear methodological specializations suggest opportunities for cross-division collaboration
3. **Platform Methods**: Literature Review, Case Study, and Simulation used across all divisions
4. **Emerging Capabilities**: Strong growth in AI methods but concentrated in few divisions
5. **Network Effects**: Method champions drive adoption - targeting key influencers could accelerate AI integration

### Recommendations for PI Decision-Making

1. **Target High-Impact Methods**: Focus AI enhancement on platform methods (Case Study, Literature Review, Simulation)
2. **Leverage Division Strengths**: Build on existing specializations rather than forcing uniform adoption
3. **Champion Development**: Invest in training method champions who can drive adoption
4. **Cross-Division Initiatives**: Create opportunities for AI-savvy divisions to share expertise
5. **Monitor Emerging Methods**: Track rapid growth areas for early investment opportunities
