The analysis focuses on identifying key constructs, measures, and interventions, and evaluating the effectiveness of diff...

  Example 2 - Document: RR-1036-AUS
  Sample: Three case studies: Newport News Shipbuilding (USA), Austal USA (USA), and Saab Aeronautics' Gripen program (Sweden).  Additional interviews and literature reviews were conducted on other shipbuilders (Bath Iron Works, Ingalls Shipbuilding, Marinette Marine Corporation), but these were not as in-dep...
  Analysis: Qualitative analysis of case studies, supplemented by quantitative data where available (e.g., employment figures, revenue data).  Critical review and interpretation of existing economic multiplier studies and their limitations....


INTERVIEWS (used in 60 studies):
  Example 1 - Document: RR-1024-JNI
  Sample: 18 CISOs were interviewed, with a non-random sample drawn from various sectors (military, communications, government, finance, manufacturing). The heuristic model simulates over 100 types of organizations....
  Analysis: Qualitative analysis of interview data was used to inform the development of a quantitative heuristic model.  Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of varying key parameters on model outcomes....

  Example 2 - Document: RR-1295-BMGF
  Sample: The study included three school districts and four charter management organizations.  Interviews were conducted with central office staff, school leaders, and teachers. Surveys were administered to all school leaders and a stratified random sample of teachers....
  Analysis: Qualitative data analysis of interviews using NVivo 10, thematic coding, and inductive coding. Quantitative analysis of survey data using Stata, including sampling weights and nonresponse adjustments.  Implementation status coded using a point system and converted to percentages. Nonresponse analysi...


DOCUMENT REVIEW (used in 53 studies):
  Example 1 - Document: RR-1024-JNI
  Sample: 18 CISOs were interviewed, with a non-random sample drawn from various sectors (military, communications, government, finance, manufacturing). The heuristic model simulates over 100 types of organizations....
  Analysis: Qualitative analysis of interview data was used to inform the development of a quantitative heuristic model.  Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of varying key parameters on model outcomes....

  Example 2 - Document: RR-1137-DFID
  Sample: The survey included all task team leaders (TTLs) and principal investigators (PIs) named on applications to the first three SIEF calls for funding.  The online focus group included 10 DFID staff. In-depth interviews were conducted with SIEF staff, NGOs, peers (e.g., 3ie, DIME), and donors (CIFF)....
  Analysis: Data from different methods were synthesized to answer six core research questions and several secondary research questions.  Analysis included comparing SIEF costs with those of peer funders, examining survey response rates and disaggregating data by respondent characteristics (position, cluster, c...


SURVEY (used in 45 studies):
  Example 1 - Document: RR-1034-OSD
  Sample: Nationally representative sample of active-duty members of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force (up to pay grade O-6), at least 18 years old at the start of the survey period.  Included both those currently serving overseas and those who had served overseas previously.  Sample size of 11,306 ...
  Analysis: Descriptive statistics, multivariate statistical modeling (probit and interval regression), cluster analysis to group attitudinal data.  Marginal effects were calculated to interpret the results of the statistical models.  Steady-state analysis was used to estimate long-run costs and savings of tour...

  Example 2 - Document: RR-1129-CMHSA
  Sample: 1,272 California K‚Äì12 public school principals (14% response rate).  Respondent schools were demographically similar to all California schools in terms of school type (elementary vs. secondary) and percentage of students receiving free or reduced-priced lunches....
  Analysis: Comparisons were made among responses of elementary, middle, and high school principals.  The report focuses on the severity of reported problems and the implementation of PEI activities, including comparisons across school levels and between schools reporting moderate or severe problems versus thos...


REGRESSION ANALYSIS (used in 34 studies):
  Example 1 - Document: RR-1130-BTS
  Sample: Household Travel Survey (HTS) data from nine waves (1999/2000 to 2007/2008) were used.  Specific waves selected varied by travel purpose to balance sample size and representativeness for the 2006 base year. Sample sizes for toll road choices and train access mode choices were analyzed to ensure suff...
  Analysis: The study used a tour-based approach to model home-based travel.  The model structure included nested logit and multinomial logit components to represent various choice decisions (mode, destination, access mode, station, toll road).  Model parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood estimatio...

  Example 2 - Document: RR-1131-BTS
  Sample: The primary data source is the Household Travel Survey (HTS) data from New South Wales, spanning multiple years (1999-2008).  Specific samples were used for different models, often based on adult status groups and travel purposes.  Data exclusion criteria varied by model and included considerations ...
  Analysis: The analysis involved re-estimating existing models with updated HTS data and refining model specifications through iterative testing and evaluation of parameter significance.  The approach involved comparing initial estimations using existing model structures with subsequent estimations incorporati...

üîç KEY FINDINGS
